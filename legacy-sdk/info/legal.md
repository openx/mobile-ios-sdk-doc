While every precaution has been taken in the preparation of this help
center, OpenX assumes no responsibility for errors or omissions or for
damages resulting from the use of information contained in these help
topics.

In addition, OpenX works with various third parties to enhance our
products through industry-leading data technologies. For example, we
rely on third-party data to infer audience locations and available
impressions, and to make determinations about traffic quality and ad
quality. In the case of traffic quality, we use third-party data to make
judgments as to what sites to block, which may result in the blocking of
sites where you may otherwise want to display ads. While we try to
choose our vendors carefully, and many of them are IAB leaders in their
respective fields, all of these assessments are inherently subject to
some level of error.

As our valued customers, we encourage you to take advantage of the
various tools that we provide for gaining insights into your performance
with our products, such as event-level feeds and canned and custom
reports, so that we may catch discrepancies quickly and maximize your
benefit.
