## OXATargeting Methods

| **Method**                               | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `addCustomParam:@"val1" withName:@"key1"`  | Adds the custom parameters. The name will be auto-prepended with `c.` to avoid collisions. Example: `addCustomParam:@"73" withName:@"temperature"` |
| `setCustomParams:@["key1":@"val1"]`        | Adds a dictionary of name-value parameter pairs, where each parameter name will be prepended with `c.` to avoid name collisions. Example: `setCustomParams:@["key1":@"val1"]` |
| `addParam:@"val1" withName:@"key1"`        | Adds a new OpenX `param` by name and sets its value. If an ad call parameter does not exist in this SDK, you can set it manually using this method.<br />Example: `addParam:@"73" withName:@"temperature"` |
| `setLatitude:latitude longitude:longitude` | Sets the latitude and longitude of a geographic location.<br>Latitude from -90.0 to +90.0, where negative is south. <br>Longitude from -180.0 to +180.0, where negative is west. |
| `resetUserAge;`                           | Sets the User Age to `0`.                                       |
| `resetUserAnnualIncomeInUS;`               | Sets the `userAnnualIncomeInUS` to `0 `.                          |


## OXASDKConfiguration

| **Method**                             | **Description**                                              | **Default** |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `defaultAutoRefreshDelay`                | Controls the initial value of `autoRefreshDelay` for all newly created `OXABannerView` in seconds. | `60`          |
| `creativeFactoryTimeout`                 | Controls how long in seconds each creative has to load before it is considered a failure. | `3`          |
| `creativeFactoryTimeoutPreRenderContent` | Controls how long (in seconds) the video and display interstitial creative has to completely pre-render before it is considered a failure. | `30`          |
| `useInternalClickthroughBrowser`         | Controls whether to use in-app browser from OpenX or the Safari app for displaying ad click-through content. | `true`        |
| `sendMRAIDSupportParams`                 | If `true`, the SDK sends "`af=3,5,6`", indicating support for MRAID. | `true`        |
| `logLevel`                             | Controls the verbosity of OpenXSDKCore's internal logger. Options are (from most to least noisy):<br />- `.info`<br />- `.warn`<br />- `.error`<br />- `.none` | `.info`       |
| `debugLogFileEnabled`                    | If `true`, the output of OpenXSDKCore's internal logger is written to a text file. This can be helpful for debugging. See [Logging](ios-sdk-logging.md). | `false`       |

Code sample:

``` swift
OXASDKConfiguration.singleton.defaultDomain = "mobile-d.openx.net"
OXASDKConfiguration.singleton.creativeFactoryTimeout = 5.0
```
