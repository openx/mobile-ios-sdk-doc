# MoPub Setup

## Overview

The sense of prebid technology is to run the header bidding auction first and inject an opportunity to display a winning bid into a preconfigured waterfall on the Primary Ad Server. This could be achieved by adding special Line Items which point to the prebid creative. If such line item wins on the primary ad server the prebid ad will be rendered on the client, otherwise, the ad from the predefined waterfall will be rendered.

This scenario is totally supported by Apollo.

So the essential part of Apollo integration is creating a special Line Items on the MoPub.  

## Best Practises 

According to prebid's suggestions, you have to create a set of line items with unique price targets to get the best revenue. Line Items should be created according to the [price granularity](http://prebid.org/prebid-mobile/adops-price-granularity.html#autoGranularityBucket) policy. That means that you have to create more than one hundred line items to get the best coverage.

### Step 2: Create Line Item
 
#### Line Item Type

To integrate the In-App Bidding into your app you have to create a Custom Ad Network Line Item with a specific Targeting keyword.

Regardless of the ability to name a Line Item in any way we strongly suggest using the price or targeting keyword in the name. It will help you when you will create a hundred of them.
