# OpenX Apollo iOS SDK

Apollo SDK is a part of OpenX Apollo platform which implements an In-App Bidding approach and gives opportunities to buyers to compete on your inventory at parallel bidding auctions. 

The current SDK version is **1.2.0**.
Go to [release notes](info/ios-in-app-bidding-release-notes.md) for all SDK versions.


> **_NOTE:_**  The documentation for the legacy OpenX SDK is available [here](legacy-sdk/LEGACY_SDK_README.md).

## Quick Start

```
# + Google Ad Manager (optional)
pod 'openx-apollo-gam-event-handlers'

# + MoPub (optional)
pod 'openx-apollo-mopub-adapters'
```
